                        Coffee is definitely the solution to all my morning woes. Cake is probably the solution to ALL my woes.<br/>
                        At least many of them! So I figured out that the best way to deal with life and its woes is to make a coffee cake. Not just any cake but a very rich, intensely coffee-ish cake. This Mocha Mud cake has been topped with Coffee Buttercream and drizzled with Mocha sauce. If you are crazy for coffee, this is your cake.

                        Itâ€™s Halloween tomorrow and I am just not guilty for making a creepy looking something. But everyone seems to be enjoying it and coming up with both scary and cute creations. I cannot make a single spooky<br/>
                        treat to save my life and since I was feeling quite left out, I thought this cake was somewhat more apt to share at this time than my floral creations. Tall, dark, handsome:-) Now tell me is it freaking you out? No? Great! That was not my intention anyway. But the taste will. It is so freaking good!

                        Pour chocolate mixture into a large bowl. Add sugar and egg, and use a wire balloon whisk to whisk<br/>
                        until well combined. Sift flours over chocolate mixture and stir with the whisk until well combined.<br/>
                        Pour into prepared pan. Bake in preheated oven for 1  1/4 hours or until crumbs cling to a skewer inserted<br/> into the centre of the cake (cover with non-stick baking paper halfway through cooking if it browns too quickly). Remove from oven and set aside to cool to room temperature.
